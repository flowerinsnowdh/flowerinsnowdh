# Hello
I am 冬花ice. Programming is my hobby, it has not completely become my life. 15 years old by 2024. Likes to be quiet but is not afraid of social interaction. A "little butterfly" who is easy to get along with.

I am a newbie who has not graduated from junior high school. I usually like to write bits and pieces and realize those small things on my own that no one has realized because they are very unpopular. By 2024, I will have 7 years of programming experience.

To see my projects go [冬花的杂碎开源工具](https://github.com/flowerinsnow-lights-opensource).

# 你好！
我是冬花ice，编程作为我的兴趣，还没有彻底成为我的生活。到2024年15岁。喜欢安静但不害怕社交，是一位很好相处的“小蝴蝶”，希望自己什么都会到走火入魔，不管是文理、艺术、生活技能、方言还是编程都想学会，那怎么可能呢

初中还没毕业的小菜鸟，平时喜欢写一点零碎的东西，靠自己实现那些很小但因为很冷门而没有人实现过的东西，到2024年已经有7年的编程经历了
